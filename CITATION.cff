abstract: >-
  GTlab (Gas Turbine Laboratory) is a versatile software
  framework designed for multidisciplinary, collaborative
  research in the field of aircraft propulsion. It supports
  the design and simulation of propulsion systems and
  individual components across various levels of detail
  throughout the entire lifecycle. With advanced core
  functions in data modeling, data management, workflow
  management, and other collaborative architectures, GTlab
  has the potential for applications far beyond the area of
  propulsion technology.


  The key strength of GTlab is its consistently implemented
  modularity. In addition to powerful core functions and
  modules, GTlab allows the integration of special
  plugin-capable extensions to support a wide range of
  applications. Its high degree of adaptability,
  extensibility and flexibility is ensured by an
  object-oriented software concept based on the C++
  programming language, coupled with the utilization of
  standardized libraries.


  GTlab's modularity is also a key factor in promoting
  teamwork and collaboration. Different teams can work
  together efficiently and combine their expertise on a
  common platform. This increases productivity while
  encouraging the interdisciplinary approach that is
  essential for solving complex engineering challenges.


  GTlab is developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) at
  the institute of Propulsion Technology.
