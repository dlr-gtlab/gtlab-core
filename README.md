# About

This repository includes the __GTlab core framework__. GTlab (Gas Turbine Laboratory) is a versatile
software framework designed for multidisciplinary, collaborative research in the field of aircraft propulsion.
It supports the design and simulation of propulsion systems and individual components across various levels
of detail throughout the entire lifecycle. With advanced core functions in data modeling, data management,
workflow management, and other collaborative architectures, GTlab has the potential for applications far beyond the area of propulsion technology.

The key strength of GTlab is its consistently implemented modularity. In addition to powerful core functions and modules, GTlab allows the integration of special plugin-capable extensions to support a wide range of applications. Its high degree of adaptability, extensibility and flexibility is ensured by an object-oriented software concept based on the C++ programming language, coupled with the utilisation of standardised libraries.

GTlab's modularity is also a key factor in promoting teamwork and collaboration. Different teams can work together efficiently and combine their expertise on a common platform. This increases productivity while encouraging the interdisciplinary approach that is essential for solving complex engineering challenges.

We welcome the development of extension modules by interested parties.
Please use our [test modules](https://github.com/dlr-gtlab/gtlab-core/tree/master/tests/modules) for a first guideline on how to implement GTlab modules.
If you are interested in collaborating with us, please feel free to [contact us](https://www.dlr.de/at/de/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1500/mailcontact-29012/).

## License

The largest portion of the code is licensed under the `Mozilla Public License 2.0` (MPL 2.0).
This license allows in particular
 - The use of GTlab in closed-source environments for commercial applications.
 - Creation and distribution of commercial modules.

Smaller thirdparty party code part of code base uses other permissive licenses, such as the
`BSD` and `MIT` licenses. Please review the directory [LICENSES](https://github.com/dlr-gtlab/gtlab-core/tree/master/LICENSES) and [.reuse](https://github.com/dlr-gtlab/gtlab-core/tree/master/.reuse)
for a full overview on all licensed used.

## Building GTlab

### Prerequisites

Our own libraries required to build GTlab are bundled with GTlab and will be automatically
downloaded during the CMake configuration phase. Whether to use the bundled libraries can be
adjusted using the CMake variable `GTLAB_USE_BUNDLED_XXX=ON`.

GTlab comes with optional support for HDF5. To enable, set `BUILD_WITH_HDF5=ON` during the config step.

| Library       |  Version  | Required | Bundled | Where to get                                 |
| ------------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Qt            |  5.15.x   | Yes      | No      | https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/ |
| GTlab Logging | >= 4.4.0  | Yes      | Yes     | https://github.com/dlr-gtlab/gt-logging      |
| GenH5         | >= 3.3.0  | No       | Yes     | https://github.com/dlr-gtlab/genh5           |
| HDF5          | >= 1.12.0 | No       | No      | https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/releases    |

### Building

GTlab requires a recent `CMake` (>3.15) to build. The configuration and build process is
similar to other CMake builds:

```
cmake -S . -B build -DQt5_DIR=<path/to/cmake/Qt5> -DHDF5_DIR=<path/to/cmake/hdf5> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/install>
cmake --build build
cmake --build build --target install
```

In case you own GTlab's development tools, you can simplify CMake's configure step via

```
cmake -S . -B build -DGTLAB_DEVTOOLS_DIR=<path/to/devtools> -DQt5_DIR=<path/to/cmake/Qt5> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/install>
```
