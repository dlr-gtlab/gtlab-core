.. note::
    For instance, if you're looking to create a custom module, you can utilize the `Module Generator <https://gitlab.dlr.de/gtlab/public/development-tools/gtlab-module-generator>`_ to automatically produce fully functional modules.
    This tool generates all the necessary source code structures needed to develop a new GTlab module, streamlining the development process and saving you valuable time.
