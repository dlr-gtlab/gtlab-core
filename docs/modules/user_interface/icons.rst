Icons in GTlab
=================

To use icons in your module in the same style as the core application you can get these from the specific namespace as given in the following example.

.. code-block:: cpp
    
    #include "gt_icons.h"
	
	myFancyButton->setIcon(gt::gui::icon::arrowLeft());
	
	
In the developer mode of GTlab you can find all available icons in the icon browser.
