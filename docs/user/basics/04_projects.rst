Projects
========

In GTlab, work is organised in the form of projects. 
This means that a project contains all data, both for the modelling of objects and systems, as well as all information on workflows etc.. 
They are therefore the superordinate element of data handling.

The following section shows how to create new projects, change or delete projects, but also how the data is organised within a project and how it can be handled.

Project Handling
----------------

Create a new project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The action to create a new project can be found in GTlab in the menu bar under File->NewProject, the short cut Ctrl+N and in the toolbar.

A wizard then guides you through all the selections that need to be made for a new project:
 - Project Specifications: Name and file path for the new project
 - Project Modules: Selection of the packages that should initially be present in the project (can also be modified later)
 - Import Data: Currently only a new empty project is possible

Add specific package to a project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When creating projects, you are already asked which packages should be part of the project data. 
This can be changed later using the **Choose Project Modules** entry in the `Context menu`_.

.. _label_section_sessions:

Sessions
^^^^^^^^
Sessions are an easy way to sort projects. Selecting the current session or creating new sessions etc. is possible in the :ref:`preferences <label_chapter_preferences_session>`.
Any number of projects can be collected in a session, whereby only one project can be open at a time.


Project Comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GTlab offers the option of adding a text comment to a project.
You can access the editor via the **Edit Comment** entry in the `Context menu`_.

.. image:: images/project_comment1_bright.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Project comment
   :class: only-light
   
.. image:: images/project_comment1_dark.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Project comment
   :class: only-dark 

If a comment is stored, this is indicated by a small speech bubble icon next to the project name and the comment appears as a tooltip when the mouse is held over this icon.

Project Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The *Project Settings* dialog can be accessed via the `Context menu`_ of a project in the Explorer.

Footprint Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The *Footprint Information* dialog can be accessed via the `Context menu`_ of a project in the Explorer.


Context menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The context menu of a project is the access point for many of the actions mentioned and for others.

   * - Action
     - Description
   * - **Open Project** 
     - Opens a clodes project.
   * - **Close Project**
     - Closes an open project.
   * - **Save Project**
     - Saves the current state of the project.
   * - **Save Project As...** 
     - Saves the current project at a different location with a different name and opens this copy in the explorer.
   * - **Open Project Settings...**
     - Opens the dialog of the `Project Settings`_.
   * - **Show Project Footprint** 
     - Opens the dialog of the `Footprint Information`_.
   * - **Edit Comment**
     - Opens the dialog to edit `Project Comments`_.
   * - **Show in Explorer**
     - Opens the folder in the computer file system containing the project file.
   * - **Rename Project**
     - Opens a dialog to rename a project. Only possible for closed projects.
   * - **Choose Project Modules**
     - Opens selection editor for the module based Packages_ which should be used in the project.
   * - **Delete from Session**
     - Deletes project from session. Only possible for closed projects. The following dialog also offers the option of removing the project completely from the computer.
   * - **Generate Backup**
     - Generates a backup.
   * - **Restore Backup**
     - Opens the dialog to restore a backup. Only possible if at least one backup of the project exists.


Project Data
------------

Packages
^^^^^^^^
Packages are elements of the first level in the project data structure, directly below the project element itself.
These usually represent a data node specific to a use case, which is usually provided via the implementation in a module.
However, this does not mean that each module provides its own data model node, 
nor does it mean that you cannot use the options of a module (e.g. its workflow elements) if you do not also activate the package in the project.

.. _label_section_properties:

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^
In GTlab, the properties of data model objects and thus also workflow elements can be described using a large selection of properties. 
The properties can be of many different types, e.g. as numerical values, texts, path specifications to files, object references and many more.

Brief explanations of some more specific elements and features follow.


Object Selection
""""""""""""""""
Object references play an important role in the properties and settings of workflow elements in particular, but also in the project data model. Processes often require data records or data objects on the basis of which simulations are carried out, for example.

There is a separate dialog for this in the properties of elements that work via such a reference.

.. image:: images/object_link1_bright.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Object references
   :class: only-light
   
.. image:: images/object_link1_dark.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Object references
   :class: only-dark 

Such a property shows the value "-" if it is not yet set. Clicking on the button with the three dots (...) opens the dialog for selecting an object that is to be referenced.
Depending on the purpose of the reference, only the selection of meaningful objects is possible in this object.

Clicking on the broom symbol resets the reference. The button with the curved arrow allows the object referenced here to be selected in the Explorer widget.  


Unit System
"""""""""""
Many properties of data model elements are described using floating point numbers. 
GTlab supports a system of units for these. This means that you can switch between the usual units for the parameter. 
For example, temperatures are specified in the SI unit *K* (Kelvin), but can also be switched to *Â°C* (Celsius) via the user interface.
This can be done by clicking on the unit.
If different options are available, a drop-down menu opens from which an alternative unit can be selected.
If the unit is changed, the corresponding numerical value is automatically converted.
The units used are not saved, so the unit is always switched back to the SI unit when the selection of the object with the property is cancelled.
