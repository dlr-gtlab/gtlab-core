About GTLab
===========

GTlab (Gas Turbine Laboratory) is a versatile software framework designed for multidisciplinary, collaborative research in the field of aircraft propulsion. 
It supports the design and simulation of propulsion systems and individual components across various levels of detail throughout the entire lifecycle.
With advanced core functions in data modeling, data management, workflow management, and other collaborative architectures, GTlab has the potential for applications far beyond the area of propulsion technology.

The key strength of GTlab is its consistently implemented modularity. In addition to powerful core functions and modules, 
GTlab allows the integration of special plugin-capable extensions to support a wide range of applications. 
Its high degree of adaptability, extensibility and flexibility is ensured by an object-oriented software concept based on the C++ programming language, coupled with the utilisation of standardised libraries.

GTlab's modularity is also a key factor in promoting teamwork and collaboration. Different teams can work together efficiently and combine their expertise on a common platform. 
This increases productivity while encouraging the interdisciplinary approach that is essential for solving complex engineering challenges.

GTlab is developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) at the `institute of Propulsion Technology <https://www.dlr.de/en/at/>`_.
