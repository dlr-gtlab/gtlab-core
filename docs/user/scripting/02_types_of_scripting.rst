Scripting of GTlab
==================

Scripting in GTlab makes it possible to automate tasks and extend the functionality of the application.  
It provides access to the Python Console, supports the creation of dynamic workflows,  
and allows integration of Python code into graph-based workflows.

Typical use cases include inspecting project data, writing custom calculators,  
implementing loops or conditional tasks, and embedding Python logic into graph nodes.
