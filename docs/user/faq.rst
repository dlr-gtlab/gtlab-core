.. _sky_blue_label:

Why is the sky blue?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because it is nice. Also because of Rayleigh scattering. 
Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light by particles smaller than the wavelength of the light.
It is responsible for the blue color of the sky during the day, because blue light has a shorter
wavelength than red light and is scattered more than red light.

Why can't I find a workflow in my project, even though I know that my colleague has created it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The workflow has probably been sorted under the colleague's user name. 
In the drop-down menu at the top of the :ref:`Process/Calculator window<label_section_processdock>`, you can change the groupings and search for the workflow in the other groups.
