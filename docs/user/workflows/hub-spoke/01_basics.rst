Basics
------

The principle behind the hub-spoke process architecture is that a central instance coordinates and manages the data flow of the process chain.
Starting from this central instance, individual sub-processes are supplied with the latest data relevant to them and then pass their results back to the central instance.

This gives rise to the image of a wheel with a hub and spokes.
